# Archive Repos

> [!NOTE]
> This script made possible with the help of ChatGPT and my little knowledge with programming.

This script is for internal testing to archive repos on my GitHub Profile which has not been updated in 2 months and archive all of them in-one-go.

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run archiveRepo.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
