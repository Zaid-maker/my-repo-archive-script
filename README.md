This script is for internal testing to archive repos on my GitHub Profile which has not been updated in 2 months and archive all of them in-one-go. I add a GitHub Action Workflow to automate this.

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run archiveRepo.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
